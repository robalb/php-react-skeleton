## php-react skeleton

this is a blank template that can be used as a starting point for complex php & react web apps

basic functionalities:
- multiple pages (every folder created in `/src/pages/` will be treated as a page entry point for webpack)
- i18n support (integrated server side and client side i18n string templating, automatic user language detection, simple language selection)
- caching for production and development mode (all bundles are dinamically imported in php using hashed names)
- integrated security: csrf, nonces, very strict header policies
- seo optimizations
